Dazed And Confused
I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman never bargained for you
Lots of people talkin and few of them know
The soul of a woman was created below

I've been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
I wanted a woman and then God sent me you
Lots of people talkin but few of them know
The soul of a woman was created below

Created below, created below, created below

I've been hurt and abused telling all of your lies
Run around baby how they hypnotise
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been
Cos I'm gonna love you, here I come again
